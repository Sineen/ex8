As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:


a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)

Pro: saving the token locally, means avoid asking from the server every time, thus less latency
Con: security, having the token saved locally risks it being stolen and used by someone else


b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server
each time the app launches again.

Pro: More secure, less chance of it being stolen
Cons: more latency, user has to wait for the request every time the app launches
